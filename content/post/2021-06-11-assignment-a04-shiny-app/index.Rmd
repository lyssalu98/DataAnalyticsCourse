## Shiny App Assignment
#### For this assignment I used the Iris dataset. I created a Shiny App that allowed the data to be sorted by species. I also wanted to allow the user to input a range of id numbers, but was unable to determine how to do that on my own. I did create a question on stackflow to try to get some help on how I may do this in the future, but unfortunately the question was not answered before I needed to submit the assignment.
